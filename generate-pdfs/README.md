# Generate PDFs with Maroto

[Maroto](https://maroto.io/#/) is a go package that allows us to generate very nice pdfs.

It uses Bootstrap for the styles and the gopdf package under the hood. It provides a really nice syntax, which abstracts all the complexity away and makes you focus on how to write a well-formatted pdf.
