# Slogs

Log is a must feature for every application. It tells us the behavior of the program when running, and also helps us with identifying possible errors.

The basic log package from go provides us basic logging operations, but for larger projects this package is not enough.

One of the things that the log pkg lacks is structured logging.

**Slogs** does provide structure logging, logging levels and customization. It's focused in optimization.
